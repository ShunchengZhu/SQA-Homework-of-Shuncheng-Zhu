**Pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives.**

**- Inspection vs. preventive actions**



- Inspection coupled with causal analysis


- Together drive preventive actions


- Key difference: error vs fault focus

**- Inspection vs. formal verification**



- FV (cid:25) formalized inspection


- Focus: people vs. mathematical/logical


- Tradeoff: formality vs. cost


- Training and acceptability issues

**- Inspection vs. testing**



- Existence of the implemented product


- Levels of quality/defects


**- Inspection vs. fault tolerance**



- Complementary instead of competing

	(e.g., inspect individual versions)



- Static vs. dynamic



- Inspection of FT techniques/mechanisms
