My understanding of the content of week 2 
    Defect handling is the most important issue and main purpose of QA. It has two main aspects. One is Defect Measurement,
  and the other is Defect Analysis. QA is very important in software process. It take a role during every step during soft-
  ware development. No matter what development mode is used, you will see QA take a part of it. V&V is a QA mode. During V&V
  mode, testing is with the whole lifecycle of software development, and the test object is not just a program, requirements, 
  and design is also needed to be tested. That is to say, testing and development is synchronized.
    There are many the key SQE activities, such as setting quality goals, forming QA strategy, analysis and feedback. SQE 
  effort in Waterfall Process is similar in other processes.
    The original purpose of testing is demonstration of proper behavior or quality demonstration. The major testing activities
  conclude test planning, preparation, execution, analysis and followup. During testing, there are two main aspects, one is 
  functional testing, the other is structural testing. And the key distinction is the perspective on what need to be checked.
